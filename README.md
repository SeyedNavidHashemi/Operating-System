# Operating System Course Projects

A collection of three comprehensive Operating System projects demonstrating process management, inter-process communication (IPC), multithreading, and network programming concepts.

## 📚 Projects

### 1. 🎮 TCP Socket Game (CA1)
A multiplayer Rock Paper Scissors game server implementing client-server architecture with multi-room support and real-time communication using TCP/UDP sockets.

**[Detailed Documentation →](./CA1/)**

---

### 2. 🏭 Multi-Process Warehouse Management (CA2)
A distributed inventory management system using multi-processing and IPC mechanisms (pipes, FIFOs) to manage warehouse inventory and calculate profits across multiple warehouses.

**[Detailed Documentation →](./CA2/)**

---

### 3. 🎵 Multithreaded Audio Processing (CA3)
An audio processing system comparing serial and parallel implementations of DSP filters (Band-pass, Notch, FIR, IIR) using POSIX threads for performance optimization.

**[Detailed Documentation →](./CA3/)**
