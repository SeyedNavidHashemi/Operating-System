# Operating System Course Projects

A collection of three comprehensive Operating System projects demonstrating process management, inter-process communication (IPC), multithreading, and network programming concepts.

## Projects

### 1.  TCP Socket Game (CA1)
A multiplayer Rock Paper Scissors game server implementing client-server architecture with multi-room support and real-time communication using TCP/UDP sockets.

---

### 2.  Multi-Process Warehouse Management (CA2)
A distributed inventory management system using multi-processing and IPC mechanisms (pipes, FIFOs) to manage warehouse inventory and calculate profits across multiple warehouses.

---

### 3.  Multithreaded Audio Processing (CA3)
An audio processing system comparing serial and parallel implementations of DSP filters (Band-pass, Notch, FIR, IIR) using POSIX threads for performance optimization.

---

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Process Management & Forking
- Inter-Process Communication (Pipes, FIFOs)
- POSIX Threads & Parallel Programming
- TCP/IP & UDP Socket Programming
- Performance Optimization & Analysis

Each project includes detailed build and usage instructions in its respective README.
